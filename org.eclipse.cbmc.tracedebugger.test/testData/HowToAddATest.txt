1 - create a new folder
2 - add the following files to the folder
	a) a file called counterexample.xml containing the counter example file generated by CBMC
	b) a file called chatter.txt (see the section below on how to format this file)
	c) the C/C++ files from which the counter example has been generated. Note that these files are not read in and are just provided for someone to easily reproduce counter examples.  
3 - add an entry in the data field of the IntegrationTest class
4 - enjoy!

Formatting the chatter file:
- The chatter file captures the MI traffic that usually happens between Eclipse CDT and GDB. It contains the commands being sent to the gdb backend and their expected response.

Command ordering: Even though in a real environment, a gdb client does not have to wait for the response to come back to send the next one. This particular test infrastructure expects to find the responses right after the commands.
This makes it easier to parse the chatter file and also to read.
Command format: A command must be on a single line
Response format: A response must be on a single line. Note that for commands that return multiple responses, each piece of the response must be on a single line (for example command exec-run --thread-group i1)
File reference: Make sure that all references to the counterexample file are replaced by <<inputFile>>
